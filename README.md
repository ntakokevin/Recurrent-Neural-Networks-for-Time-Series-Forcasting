# Recurrent-Neural-Networks-for-Time-Series-Forcasting

This project focuses on implementing a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for time series forecasting. Time series forecasting is a critical task in various domains, including finance, weather prediction, stock market analysis, and sales forecasting. RNNs, with their ability to capture sequential dependencies, are particularly well-suited for this task.

The goal of this project is to develop an accurate and reliable model that can predict future values in a time series based on historical data. By leveraging the power of RNNs, we can capture the temporal patterns and dependencies present in the data, enabling us to make accurate predictions.

The project begins by preprocessing the time series data, including data cleaning, normalization, and splitting into training and testing sets. The RNN architecture is then constructed, typically using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells or Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to handle long-term dependencies and mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.

Throughout the project, TensorFlow, a popular open-source deep learning library, is used to simplify the implementation of the RNN model. TensorFlow provides efficient computation and high-level abstractions for building and training neural networks.

The key steps involved in this project include:
<ol>
<li>Preprocessing the time series data, including handling missing values, normalizing the data, and splitting it into training and testing sets.</li>
<li>Designing the RNN architecture, selecting the appropriate type of RNN cells, and specifying the number of layers and hidden units.</li>
<li>Training the RNN model using the training set and optimizing its parameters to minimize the forecasting error.</li>
<li>Evaluating the trained model's performance on the test set, assessing its accuracy in predicting future values and capturing trends and patterns.</li>
<li>Fine-tuning and optimizing the RNN architecture, experimenting with different hyperparameters or architectural variations to improve the forecasting accuracy.</li>
</ol>

By completing this project, you will gain hands-on experience in implementing RNNs for time series forecasting and understand the underlying principles of sequence modeling. Furthermore, you will have a functional model that can effectively forecast future values in time series data.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different architectural configurations, hyperparameters, or additional preprocessing techniques to further enhance the forecasting performance. Additionally, you may consider incorporating other advanced techniques such as attention mechanisms or ensembling to improve the accuracy and robustness of the predictions.
